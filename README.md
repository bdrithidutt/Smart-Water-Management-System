# Smart Water System 💧

This project uses an **ESP32** to monitor water levels and send data to **ThingSpeak**.

## 📦 Hardware Used:
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Water level sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Wi-Fi

## ☁️ Cloud Integration:
- Uses **ThingSpeak** to log and visualize water level data in real time.

## 🚀 How it Works:
1. ESP32 reads data from water sensor.
2. It connects to Wi-Fi.
3. Sends data to your ThingSpeak channel.
4. You can view live graphs on ThingSpeak.

## 📷 Circuit Diagram:
See `assets/circuit_diagram.png` for connections.
